# Tweet Approved
A simple app that allows people to submit tweets for approval by another. Users can create, review, update, and delete each tweet, and can tweet directly from the app after signing into Twitter.

For further detail on the development process, see my production [TweetApproved repo](https://github.com/dtphelan/tweetapproved).
